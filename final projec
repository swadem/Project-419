# just doing simple plotting to visualize the data

# this graph shows the frequency of age of diagnosis

ax1 = sns.distplot(age_of_diagnosis, kde=False, bins=125, color='black')
ax1.set_title("Age of diagnosis for the Phase 2 \n COG-AALL0232 Clinical Trial")
ax1.set_xlabel("Age of diagnosis in Days")
ax1.set_ylabel("Frequency")

# this graph compares the age of diagnosis vs the WBC at diagnosis, with color coding gender
sns.lmplot(x="Age at Diagnosis in Days", y="WBC at Diagnosis", 
           data=df, hue="Gender", fit_reg=False)

#on another note, 
#not sure why this won't this work:
#overall_survival = df["Overall Survival Time in Days"]
#or not even working when I try to graph it using sns.lmplot
#I think it'd be really powerful to use the overall survival time
#but I'm not sure why it's saying that this column isn't in the index
#I'll work on it later but for now I'm giving up on fixing the data
#nice
