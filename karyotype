#The first numbers in the column "Karyotype" are the total number of 
#chromosomes that the researchers collected from each individual patient
#Some patients have no Karyotype information

#Making a data frame of just the column "Karyotype"
k = df["Karyotype"]

#Dropping the NaN values
knpd = k.dropna(axis = 0, how='any')

#First, I need to make the data as string type
strings = knpd.astype(str).values
k_strings = strings.ravel()

#I made a for loop to collect the karyotype numbers in it's own array called "karyotype_num"
karyotype_num = []
for x in k_strings:
    first_two = x[0:2]
    karyotype_num.append(first_two) #karyotype_num is a list type

#I have changed it to a Pandas DF called "karyotype_number"
#but it still contains string values
k_arr = (np.array(karyotype_num))
karr = pd.DataFrame(k_arr)


#### ------- this needs to be fixed ---------
#I noticed an error where one of the cells had a space before the first number began
#which resulted in one karyotype value being "_4" instead of "46"
#below is my attempt to fix this
for x in k_arr:
    if x == 4:
        np.place(k_arr, x, 46)

karyo = []
for x in k_arr.size:
    uh = k_arr[x]
    print(uh)
    #uh.astype(int)
    #karyo.append(uh)
